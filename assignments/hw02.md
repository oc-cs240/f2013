Reconceive the poker hand evaluator from HW01. The new version should use the
random generator to create poker hands. Prompt the user for input, to determine
the number of hands to evaluate, and prompt the user to choose between 5- and
7-card hands. After all hands have been evaluated, print a table containing the
probablities of each hand rank.

All programs requiring input, from this assignment forward, must verify the
input as safe, so either prompts are repeated, or the programs fail and
exit gracefully.
