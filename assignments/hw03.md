### Programming

Keno slips (see below) offer bettors both the payouts and the chances of
winning, given a particular number of spots wagered. Write a simulation that
tests these offered values.

Use random number generation to choose house picks (20 numbers picked 1-80)
and player picks (varies by game, picked 1-80). Run each game type over 1 million trials, with
reporting every 100,000 trials, and a summary at the end. Use 3 decimal places
for all percents, and 2 decimal places for odds.

    # Example output
