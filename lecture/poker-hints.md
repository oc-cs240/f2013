Help with Poker
===============

Trying to solve the 5-card hand from 7 cards issue, we need help with
combinations. Enter the itertools module from the standard library.



    import itertools
    from random import shuffle
    
    # Use list comprenhension to create a deck!
    deck = [(face, suit) for face in range(1, 14) for suit in range(4)]
    print('Unshuffled 52-card deck')
    print(deck)
    shuffle(deck)
    print('Shuffled deck:')
    print(deck)
    
    hand7 = deck[:7]
    print('7-card hand:')
    print(hand7)
